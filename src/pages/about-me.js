              <p>
              I am a web developer who is passionate about web design and writing code that translates into robust and user-friendly experiences. 
              </p>
              <p>
              I have been working in a digital consultancy for over 2 years. 
              Turning clientsâ€™ ambitions into reality from the design process up until delivery of the software. 
              </p>
              <p>
              It is the application of technology in businesses that particularly interest me. 
              This is also why the majority of my time as a developer has been around the e-commerce space. Helping 
              clients build software that will further allow them to reach their business goals.
              </p>
