<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
I have recently updated my personal webpage in order to utilize some of the more modern technologies (React.js, Gatsby.js). This was a great learning tool for me! This project is also a constant work in progress as I always seek to learn new things and test out. What better way to do this they on a personal portfolio webpage to show off! :)
